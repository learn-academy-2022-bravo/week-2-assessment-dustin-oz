# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter gets passed into a function for example, and the argument is like a reference to the parameter inside the codeblock.

  Researched answer: After research, function parameters are listed in the function definition. Function arguments are the values passed to the function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: From memory, .map() takes in a value, index and the array. Of the three, only value is required. It is the same with other methods like filter.

  Researched answer: After researching to verify my answer, I verified that my answer was correct. I pulled the syntax from w3 schools to paste here. - array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue) -



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: From memory, map loops over and "does something" to each element it touches along with returning the original array. Filter makes a "decision" on each element it touches and returns a portion or subset of an array.

  Researched answer: After researching this answer, the answers found were just like mine with a slightly different wording.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: From memory, a function is a rusable code machine that a developer makes to complete a given task or tasks. Methods are also built by developers but they are "built in", common use functions that devlopers have decided are used so much that essentially "javascript function presets" were made and called methods. Why capitalize words over and over when you could simply create a built in method to achieve the same thing with a single method.

  Researched answer: After researching this answer, I was on target with my answer. I have nothing more that add here.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: From memory, destructuring is the pulling of specific data from things like arrays and objects and can map them into a new variable for use somewhere.

  Researched answer: After researching I additionally learned destructuring is a "javascript expression" and is used to extract multiple properties from an arrayâ€‹ at a time.
